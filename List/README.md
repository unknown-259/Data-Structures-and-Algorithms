Our goal is to build an Integer List ADT in C and use it to indirectly alphabetize the lines in a file.

List.h: ADT header file

List.c: Implementation of integer list ADT

ListTest.c: Tests the integer list ADT

Lex.c: Insertion sort of the elements

Makefile: Builds the program

README.md: List of files
