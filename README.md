# Data Structures & Algorithms

1. List: Integer List ADT in C and use it to indirectly alphabetize the lines in a file
2. Graph: Implement a Graph ADT and some associated algorithms in C
3. FindComponents: Build a Graph module in C that implements the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm
4. Matrix: Create a calculator for performing matrix operations that exploits the (expected) sparseness of its matrix operands
5. List (C++): Integer List ADT in C++ and use it to indirectly alphabetize the lines in a file
6. BigInteger: An ADT in C++ that is capable of performing arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large signed integers
